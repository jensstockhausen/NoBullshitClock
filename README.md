# No Bullshit Clock for Android 

On the lookout for a plain night stand clock and being fed up with the ad filled free apps I created this.

Just the time, five settings for the brightness (just tap). No other configuration.

Build it based on the basic template for my S10, should work for most phones, but no guarantee ;-)
